# FlowerTune LLM on Finance Dataset

This directory conducts federated instruction tuning with a pretrained Qwen-2.5-7B (https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B) model on a Finance dataset.
We use [Flower Datasets](https://flower.dev/docs/datasets/) to download, partition and preprocess the dataset.
Flower's Simulation Engine is used to simulate the LLM fine-tuning process in federated way,
which allows users to perform the training on a single GPU.


## Methodology

This baseline performs federated LLM fine-tuning with [LoRA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09685) using the [ðŸ¤—PEFT](https://huggingface.co/docs/peft/en/index) library.
The clients' models are aggregated with either FedAvg or FlexLoRA strategy. 

## Environments setup

Project dependencies are defined in `pyproject.toml`. Install them in an activated Python environment with:

```shell
cd flower-finance
pip install -e .
```

## Experimental setup

The dataset is divided into 50 partitions in an IID fashion, a partition is assigned to each ClientApp.
We randomly sample a fraction (0.1) of the total nodes to participate in each round, for a total of `10` rounds.
To run the challenge, use the following command:
```shell
flwr run
```
All settings are defined in `pyproject.toml`. To run experiments with flexlora, set `use_flexlora` to `1` through:
```shell
flwr run --run-config "use_flexlora=1
```

## Evaluation Result


|          | fiqa  |  fpb  | tfns  | Average |
|:--------:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-------:|
|  FedAvg  | 67.8 | 76.9 | 69.68 |  40.0  |

All experiments are conducted using 2 RTX 3090 (24 GB) GPUs.
